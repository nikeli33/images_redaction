The cropping UI has been updated to remove the miniature thumbnail preview. The `CropOverlay.tsx` component has been created and integrated into `CropMode.tsx` to provide the dimming and selection rectangle with handles.

To verify the changes, please perform the following manual tests:
1. Run the application (e.g., `npm run dev` or `bun run dev`).
2. Navigate to the cropping functionality.
3. Upload an image.
4. Move and resize the selection rectangle.
   - **Verify:** The small thumbnail preview should no longer appear inside the selection rectangle.
   - **Verify:** The area outside the selection should be dimmed, while the selected area remains visually normal (or slightly highlighted) and shows a clear border and draggable handles.
   - **Verify:** The drag and resize functionality of the selection rectangle and its handles should still work correctly.
5. Click the 'Crop' action.
   - **Verify:** The final cropped result should be correct and unchanged, indicating that the underlying cropping logic (which reads exact selection coordinates) is still functioning as expected.

If the codebase uses Tailwind, you might consider converting the inline styles in `CropOverlay.tsx` to equivalent utility classes for consistency, as mentioned in the optional UX touches.
